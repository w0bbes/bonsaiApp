The BonsaiApp


The Bonsai is an effort to list and show all bonsai types in the world and giving the community a place to post pictures, make comments and discuss trees.

At the least this project should contain a overview of all trees with sorting and ordering options.

The details pages will contain detailed information about the tree and a community section where you can post and upload images, make comments and discuss stuff like growing patterns, feeding and supplies.
